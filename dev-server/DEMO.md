   export const AuditProgressCard = ({ progress }) => {
     const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);
     
     return (
       <View style={{padding: 16, backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0'}}>
         <Text>Audit Progress: {progress}%</Text>
         <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}>
           <Text>Toggle Details</Text>
         </TouchableOpacity>
         {expanded && (
           <Text>Additional audit details here...</Text>
         )}
       </View>
     );
   };
   ```
4. **Start Review**: Get feedback from both AI agents
