## Conversation

### Claude
Idea 1: Exploring quick test from perspective of scalability and user experience

### Gemini
Idea 2: A "Quick Test" feature for ad-hoc data capture. Users could instantly log a single critical data point (e.g., a temperature reading) directly from the main dashboard, bypassing the full inspection workflow for rapid, unscheduled checks.

**Idea 3: "Quick Test" as a Corrective Action Follow-up.** When a Non-Conformance Report (NCR) is generated, the system automatically creates a "Quick Test" for the specific item that failed. This test is assigned to a user and appears on their dashboard, allowing them to quickly verify and document that the corrective action has been effective, directly linking the ad-hoc check to the quality management loop.

### Gemini
**Idea 4: "Quick Test" for Routine Monitoring & Audits.** Pre-configure and schedule recurring "Quick Tests" for critical control points that require frequent monitoring (e.g., daily sanitation checks, weekly equipment calibration). This automates routine data collection for trend analysis, distinct from ad-hoc checks or reactive NCR follow-ups.
