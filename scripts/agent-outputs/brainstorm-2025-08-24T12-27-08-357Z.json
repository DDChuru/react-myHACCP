      "idea": "**Idea 3: A \"Quick Test\" as an Action-Oriented Triage System.** Instead of just logging data, a 'Fail' or 'Monitor' result automatically triggers a predefined workflow, such as creating a corrective action request, notifying a manager, or scheduling a detailed follow-up inspection. This transforms the quick test from a passive data-logging tool into an active, real-time risk management system."

      "idea": "**Idea 4: \"Quick Test\" as a Gamified, Team-Based Compliance Score.** Introduce a real-time dashboard that visualizes \"quick test\" results (Pass/Fail/Monitor) as a live compliance score, both for individuals and teams/areas. A streak of 'Pass' results could unlock achievements or positive feedback, while 'Fail' results might temporarily lower the score, encouraging immediate corrective action to bring it back up. This leverages gamification to foster a culture of proactive monitoring and friendly competition around maintaining standards."
