      "idea": "**Idea 3: Collaborative Corrective Action Plans.**\n\nFollowing an inspection, relevant stakeholders (e.g., quality manager, line supervisor, maintenance) are pulled into a live, shared document to collaboratively build the corrective action plan in real-time. This allows for immediate, cross-functional input on root cause analysis, task assignment, and verification steps, ensuring rapid alignment and accelerating the resolution of the non-conformance."

      "idea": "**Idea 4: Live Operational Dashboard.**\n\nA real-time, facility-wide dashboard that visualizes ongoing inspections, live non-conformance alerts, and data from critical control points (e.g., IoT temperature sensors). Managers can monitor operations at a glance and drill down into specific inspections to provide support, offering a high-level oversight that complements the in-the-weeds collaboration of other ideas."
