### Gemini
**Alternative Idea:** Generate 5 engaging definitions of food safety by framing each as a "golden rule" from a different culinary professional's perspective (e.g., a Michelin-star chef, a street food vendor, a molecular gastronomist, a grandparent, a food scientist).

### Gemini
**Alternative Idea:** Generate 5 engaging definitions of food safety by framing each as a "secret" or "hack" from an elite food-world insider (e.g., a food critic's secret for avoiding illness, a farmer's market pro's tip for freshness, a caterer's hack for serving crowds safely).
