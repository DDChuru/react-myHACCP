## üìù Notes

### Key Decisions
1. Using expo-image-picker for camera/gallery access (already installed)
2. Firebase Storage for image persistence
3. expo-image for optimized image loading (better than FastImage for Expo)
4. Context API for state management (simpler than Redux)
5. expo-file-system for offline queue (mobile-focused)
6. **Mobile-first development** - Not supporting web to simplify implementation

### Technical Constraints
- Max image size: 10MB
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- Thumbnail size: 150px
- Medium size: 600px
- Compression quality: 85%

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
# Only one package needed!
npx expo install expo-image-manipulator
```

### Why Minimal Dependencies?
- ‚úÖ Using `expo-image` instead of FastImage (already installed, better caching)
- ‚úÖ Using `expo-file-system` for offline storage (already installed)
- ‚úÖ Using Context API instead of Redux (simpler for this feature)
- ‚úÖ Using `expo-image-manipulator` for compression (Expo native solution)

### Branch Context
Current: master
Purpose: Main development branch - self-inspection module is complete and ready for production

### Notes
**CONTEXT CLEARING RECOMMENDATION**: The self-inspection feature is fully complete and production-ready. Since this represents a major milestone completion, consider using `/clear` to start fresh context for the next feature development (SCI Image Capture). All essential context has been documented in the project files.

**COMMIT RECOMMENDATION**: The completed self-inspection work should be committed before moving to SCI development to preserve the milestone.

**Last Updated**: August 24, 2025
**Next Review**: Ready for feature transition or context clearing
