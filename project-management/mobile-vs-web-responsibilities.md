## Mobile Implementation Guidelines

### Dashboard Screen Structure
```
/(drawer)/self-inspection/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.tsx        # Main dashboard with tabs
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-issues.tsx        # Issues assigned to me
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-inspections.tsx   # My recent inspections
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IssueCard.tsx
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MetricsWidget.tsx
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NotificationBadge.tsx
```

### Data Optimization for Mobile
1. **Pagination**: Load 20 items at a time
2. **Caching**: Store last 7 days locally
3. **Refresh**: Pull-to-refresh pattern
4. **Offline**: Show cached data with indicator

### UI/UX Considerations
- Large touch targets (minimum 44x44 points)
- Swipe actions for quick acknowledge
- Bottom sheet for filters
- Floating action button for new inspection
- Color coding for severity/status

## Web Implementation Notes

### Technology Stack Recommendations
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with Material-UI or Ant Design
- **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js
- **Tables**: AG-Grid or MUI DataGrid
- **Reports**: jsPDF or React-PDF
- **Real-time**: Firebase Realtime Database or WebSockets

### Key Differentiators from Mobile
1. **Multi-column layouts** for information density
2. **Advanced filtering** with multiple criteria
3. **Bulk actions** for multiple issues
4. **Export capabilities** in various formats
5. **Print-optimized views**
6. **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users

## Data Sync Strategy

### Mobile ‚Üí Cloud
- Immediate sync when online
- Queue changes when offline
- Batch upload for efficiency

### Cloud ‚Üí Mobile
- Push critical updates (new assignments)
- Pull non-critical on app foreground
- Scheduled sync every 30 minutes

### Web ‚Üí Cloud
- Real-time bidirectional sync
- WebSocket for live updates
- No offline consideration needed

## Implementation Priority

### Mobile (Current Sprint)
1. ‚úÖ My Issues Dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Quick Acknowledge Action  
3. ‚úÖ In-App Notifications
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Simple Metrics Widget (nice-to-have)

### Web (Future Sprint)
1. üìù RACI Configuration Interface
2. üìù Executive Dashboard
